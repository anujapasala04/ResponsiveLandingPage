# ResponsiveLandingPage
This task involves creating a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS. It includes a header with navigation, a hero section with a title and button, and a footer with social links. The layout is built using Flexbox and made mobile-friendly using media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.
Responsive Landing Page – Explanation
What is this project?
This is a simple and responsive landing page built using HTML5 and CSS3. The goal of the project is to create a webpage that works well on all screen sizes — desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. It includes a header, a hero section, and a footer. This project helps in understanding the basics of web development like HTML structure, CSS styling, layout with Flexbox, and responsiveness with media queries.

Structure of the Page
The landing page is divided into three main sections:

Header
The header includes a logo on the left and navigation links on the right (like Home, Features, About, Contact). Flexbox is used to place them in a row and keep them aligned.

Hero Section
This section is placed in the center of the page and contains a large heading, a short paragraph, and a call-to-action button (like “Get Started”). It's styled to catch the visitor’s attention.

Footer
The footer contains social media links and a copyright line. It appears at the bottom of the page.

Styling (CSS)
CSS is written in a separate file (style.css) to keep the code clean and organized.

Flexbox is used to align elements inside the header and other sections.

Media queries are used to make the page look good on smaller screens like mobile devices.

The design is clean, modern, and uses simple colors for a professional look.

Responsiveness
The page is fully responsive. This means:

On large screens (like laptops), everything is shown in a horizontal layout.

On small screens (like mobiles), the layout automatically changes — for example, the navigation links stack below the logo.

Font sizes and spacing are also adjusted for readability on all devices.
